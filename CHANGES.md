# `coqffi.1.0.0`

This will be the initial release of `coqffi`.

# `coqffi.1.0.0~beta8`

- **Breaking Change:** The `CoqFFI` theory has been flattened, *i.e.*,
  the `CoqFFI.Data.*` modules has been moved to `CoqFFI.*`.
- **Breaking Change:** `coqffi` now correctly handles tuples, whereas
  in previous versions the extraction of tuples of more than 2
  elements was broken.  Only tuples up to 20 elements are supported.
- **Breaking Change:** `Rename `tupN` into `tupleN` to avoid
  unfortunate shadowing with `data-encoding`
- **Dependencies:** Support OCaml 4.13 and 4.14
- **Fix:** Extraction commands for asynchronous primitives were not
  handling labelled arguments correctly.
- **Fix:** Extraction commands for asynchronous primitives were not
  fully qualifying OCaml values.
- **Fix:** `coqffi` was sometimes using the Coq arrow `=>` instead of
  the OCaml arrow `->`.
- **Fix:** `coqffi` now behaves correctly when a library contains a
    module named after it. In that case, `dune` uses this module to
    set the public interface of the library.

## `coqffi.1.0.0~beta7`

- **Feature:** Add a new feature called `tezos` that implements a
  ad-hoc heuristic for distinguishing between pure and impure
  functions in Tezos protocols.
- **Dependencies:** Support OCaml 4.12
- **Fix:** Name functions arguments in Coq based on their position
  alone, to reduce the risk to have a naming clash between polymorphic
  type name and labeled arguments.

## `coqffi.1.0.0~beta6`

- **Breaking Change:** `coqffi` support of `Lwt` has been improved. It
  now handles “higher-order primitives” —that is, primitives where the
  `Lwt.t` not only appaers in the head position of the return type,
  but also in their arguments for instance— more smoothly (`-flwt`)
- **Feature:** Support labelled and optional arguments
- **Feature:** Support primitive floats
- **Feature:** Support 32bits signed integers
- **Feature:** `coqffi` can now generate equivalent Coq types for
  OCaml records.  However, it still does not support inline records
  (`ftransparent-types`)
- **Fix:** Improve `coqffi` resilience against unfortunate shadowing
  of Coq definitions. `coqffi` will now deal correctly with several
  fields having the same name, or several types having the same
  constructors, etc.
- **Fix:** `coqffi` now generates typeclass instances that Coq can
  better typecheck. The previous generation was mostly correct, but
  there were some erroneous cases that were hard to characterize. This
  is why the new generation is systematically used for polymorphic
  primitives, instead of only when required
- **Fix:** `coqffi` now handles correctly the translation of types
  within successive inner modules, whereas it was only considering the
  first one previously

## `coqffi.1.0.0~beta5`

- **Dependencies** Support Coq 8.13 in addition to Coq 8.12
- **Fix:** For an operator `o`, `coqffi` now uses the syntax `( o )`
  in place of `(o)`, so that `(*)` is never outputted

## `coqffi.1.0.0~beta4`

- **Breaking Change:** When the `lwt` feature is enabled, `coqffi` now
  treats asynchronous functions differently *even if* the
  `pure-module` feature is enabled, whereas they were translated as
  pure functions before (`-flwt`, `-fpure-module`)
- **Feature:** Support OCaml GADT (`-ftransparent-types`)
- **Feature:** Users can defined their own aliases using a
  configuration file (`-a ALIASES`)
- **Feature:** Add a new feature to support asynchronous functions
  (powered by the `Lwt` framework) (`-flwt`)
- **Feature:** `coqffi` can now generate a “witness file” which
  summarizes the types introduced by the Coq module (`--witness`),
  and consumes these witness files using a dedicated options (`-I`)
  to populate its translation tables
- **Feature:** Support type aliases (*i.e.*, entries of the form `type
  t = u`)
- **Fix:** Support polymorphic constructor such as `type box = Box :
  'a -> box`
- **Fix:** Complete the list of reserved Gallina keywords using [the
  Coq reference manual][coq-refman]
- **Fix:** `coqffi` will not fail when confronted to an OCaml type of
  the form `type foo = Foo { bar : bool; foobar : int }`
- **Fix:** Close the `nat_scope` scope in generated module to avoid
  confusion between `prod` and the `nat` multiplication
- **Fix:** `coqffi` now translates correctly the types used outside of
  the module which introduces them
- **Fix:** `coqffi` now generates axioms for types it cannot translate
  (`-ftransparent-types`)
- **Fix:** Correctly identify the extraction target for entries
  defined inside a module
- **Fix:** Prevent naming conflicts between types and values
- **Fix:** `coqffi` now filters types whose name starts with #, since
  it is still unclear how the object system of OCaml shall be treated
- **Fix:** Enforce that the name of the constructors of an interface
  does not conflict with registered Coq keywords (`-finterface`)
- **Fix:** Improve the support for shadowing existing types
  (`-ftransparent-types`)
- **Fix:** Exclude the OCaml values which make use of named argument
  (either optional or not)

## `coqffi.1.0.0~beta3`

- **Breaking Change:** OCaml functions are now assumed impure and can
  be explicitly marked as pure with the `pure` attribute, while the
  rest of OCaml values are always considered pure (OCaml values
  were previously considered pure by default, and could be marked
  using the `impure` attribute)
- **Breaking Change:** The `coq_model` attribute implies the marked
  value is pure (it was previously ignored when used in conjuction
  with the `impure` attribute)
- **Feature:** Add a new feature to assume all OCaml values of
  the input OCaml module interface are pure (`-fpure-module`)
- **Feature:** Add `Seq.t` and `result` to the list of the primitive
  types supported by `coqffi`
- **Feature**: In presence of a constuction of the form `exception Foo
  of bar`, coqffi now generates a “proxy” type `FooExn`, along with
  conversion functions from and to `exn`, and an instance for the
  `Exn` typeclass provided by the `CoqFFI` theory
- **Feature:** Support the `may_raise` attribute to mark pure function
  and impure primivites susceptible to raise exceptions
- **Feature:** `coqffi` will no longer abort when confronting an input
  it cannot handle, but will rather print a warning explaining why
  a given entry will not be part of the generated Coq module
- **Feature:** `coqffi` now supports signature modules
- **Feature:** `coqffi` now uses aliases for some OCaml operators,
  and Gallina reserved keywords
- **Feature:** `coqffi` now supports unamed OCaml polymorphic types
- **Fix:** Make sure module names are always capitalized

## `coqffi.1.0.0~beta2`

- **Fix:** Extraction of inductive constructors
  (`-ftransparent-types`)
- **Fix:** Generate the missing instance for the interface inductive
  type (`-finterface`)

## `coqffi.1.0.0~beta1`

- **Feature:** Generation of the boilerplate to use `coq-simple-io`
  (`-fsimple-io`)
- **Feature:** Generation of an inductive type which describes the
  sets of impure primitives of the OCaml module interface
  (`-finterface`)
- **Feature:** Generation of a FreeSpec semantics (`-ffreespec`)
- **Experimental Feature:** Generation of inductive types when
  possible (`-ftransparent-types`)
